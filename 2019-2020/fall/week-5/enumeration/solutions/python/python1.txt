This example requires simply looking at the source code and figuring out
the correct password.

All the password checking code resides in "checkPassword".
Line 7 checks for a password that is less than 8 characters long.
Line 10 checks that the ascii sum of all characters is equal to 960.
Line 13 checks for two things:
	* That the sixth character in the password has the ascii value 91
	* The ascii sum of the first three characters is 260

Any string that satisfies these criteria will be accepted by the program

This exercise requires decompiling the .pyc file to a normal python file.

To perform this, a decompiler is necessary. Use the Python Package Manager to
install uncompyle using the command, "pip3 install uncompyle".

Now simply run "uncompyle6 <.pyc file>" and it will output the source code.
Use this to understand the program. You can then run the the .pyc file normally
using "python3 <.pyc file>"
